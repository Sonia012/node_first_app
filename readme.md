# Description

Half February 2019. The instructions we received from our BeCode coach are the following: 
        We'll build a very simple user management app. With no UI other than the API endpoints we'll design in a RESTfull manner and the data stored locally as a .json file with read/write functionalities. At multiple steps we'll be making use of postman, our favorite API development environment.


# Technologies used

- node.js/Express
